Generalization tests for k = 5 and k = 7:
During 4-fold cross validation, k = 5 achieved 89.12% accuracy and k = 7 achieved 89.11% accuracy.
Since these %s are basically the same, the generalization performance of each of them was assessed.

Resulting output from code:
For k = 5:

Testing generalization Performance for optimal k value (k = 5)...
Example split: 80/20 to training and testing, respectively

Generalization performance: k value: 5, accuracy: 88.75%

For k = 7:
Testing generalization Performance for optimal k value (k = 7)...
Example split: 80/20 to training and testing, respectively

Generalization performance: k value: 7, accuracy: 89.58%
